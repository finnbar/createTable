This is a little .love application that allows you to create a 2d array from a drawing that you make (on an 8x8 grid). Requires LOVE2D, but if you ask me nicely I'll post a Windows/Mac build somewhere. But seriously, just get LOVE2D, it's super awesome, it's free and it's open source. And it's not massive, OK?

This is particularly useful for when programming the DIY Gamer Kit from Technology Will Save Us!

See example output for an example.
